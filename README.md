"The main problem which i was identify that product information on e-commerce websites is unstructured, making it difficult to compare prices and features across different brands.”
“To solve this, I built a Python-based web scraper using Requests and BeautifulSoup to collect washing machine listings.
I extracted key attributes such as brand, capacity, automation type, load type, current price, original price, discount, ratings, and reviews.”
“The biggest challenge was data cleaning. The scraped data contained currency symbols, inconsistent text formats, missing values, and outliers.
I cleaned the data by standardizing formats, removing symbols, filling missing values using median and mode, and handling outliers using the IQR method.”
“After cleaning, I performed univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to understand price distribution, brand-wise trends, and how product features influence pricing.”
“From the analysis, I found that fully automatic and front-load washing machines are usually more expensive, most products are priced between ₹10,000 and ₹25,000, and brand and capacity play an important role in pricing, while ratings are similar across price ranges.”
“Overall, this project gave me hands-on experience in real-world web scraping, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and converting raw data into meaningful business insights."
